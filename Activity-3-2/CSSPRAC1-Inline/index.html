    <h1 style="color: red; font-family: Arial;">A LIST OF LISTS</h1>
    
    <p style="color: navy; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Lists of the best, the worst, the most popular, and the funniest are all over the Web. Here are some of our favorites.</p>
    
    <h2>Most Wanted</h2>
    
    <p style="color: navy; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Mugs from the <em>FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives</em> are always available here. Two years ago, comic-strip detective Dick Tracy joined the hunt and published profiles from the list, including one of Osama bin Laden. "This walk's with us cane," it said.</p>

    <h2>The Lycos 50</h2>
    
    <p style="color: navy; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Who is hot and who is not in online searches? When we checked, Osama bin Laden and <em>Martha Stewart</em> were on the decline, while Christmas and Harry Potter were ascending on the list of most popular search terms at the Lycos service.</p>

    <h2>List Universe</h2>
    
    <p style="color: navy; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">E-mail lists are Internet communities that share e-mail messages on any subject imaginable - and some that aren't. List Universe is for anyone trying to set up a list, or to keep one going. It gives tips on promoting a list, selling advertising for e-zines, and writing for an online audience.</p>
